# Hi Fellow Devs 👋
Hi, I'm Cristian. A computer science enginner at MnD. I live in Arica, CH. 🙌 I'm a huge nerd/geek. 💕

## My values
💖 Safety and trust<br>
🌟 Expression as authentic self<br>
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
🙌 Shared norms<br>
🚀 Elevate the underrepresented

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
